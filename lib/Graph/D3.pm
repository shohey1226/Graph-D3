=head1 NAME

Graph::D3 - Create ref/json to show node-edge graph with D3.js 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Graph;
  use Graph::D3;
  my $g = new Graph(
      vertices => [qw/1 2 3 4 5/], 
      edges => [[qw/1 2/], [qw/2 3/], [qw/3 5/], [qw/4 1/]] 
  );
  my $d3 = new Graph::D3(graph => $g);
  my $output = $d3->force_directed_graph(); #output is hash reference
  $output = $d3->hierarchical_edge_bundling(); #output is hash reference

  $d3 = new Graph::D3(graph => $g, type => json); 
  my $json = $d3->force_directed_graph(); # output is json format
  $json = $d3->hierarchical_edge_bundling(); # output is json format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Graph::D3 is a module to convert Graph object to the format which is used in d3.js(http://d3js.org/).
This module simply supports node-edge graph in the example.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 force_directed_graph 

This outputs the format which is used for Force Directed Graph described below.

L<https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4062045>, L<http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045>

The input graph should be directed grpah.
Node in Graph can have 'group' attribute (Default is all 1) to have different node color.
Also Edge in Graph can have 'value' attribute (default is all 1).

=head2 hierarchical_edge_bundling 

L<http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/bundle.html>

The input graph should be directed graph.
Node in Graph can have 'size' attribute (Default is all 1).
